# beta_ensemble_sampling
This small project produces eigenvalue samples of the classical G/L/J beta E ensembles using tridiagonal matrices.  

description for file tridiagonal.jl:
    --- tridiagonal eigenvalue sampling routines for Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi beta ensembles
    --- uses ideas from the Edelman--Dumitriu (and Killip--Nenciu for Jacobi ensembles) tridiagonal method described in (e.g. for Laguerre) Theorem 2.2 of the paper 'Fast sampling from beta-ensembles' by Gautier--Bardenet--Valko arXiv:2003.02344 [stat.CO]
